When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other people; or when working from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I have not read the automatic update section yet. But I have added this
    response using Github website.
    I think this might be due to the fact that if someone has changed the GitHub file,
    then we don't want to automatically over-write our local drive. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is basically getting the exact copy of the repository from Github into 
    your local computer.
    Branch is used when we are doing experimental work, or side projects from the 
    main branch, before merging it in.
    Fork is when you get someone else's repository and copy it to your account 
    and keep working on it from your own repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
