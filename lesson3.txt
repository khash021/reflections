I am very new to programming and I love Udacity. It has made the journey way easier, and more pleasant.
As you can also say, I have just started using Git, which is something that I was looking for (without 
knowing what I was looking for) since I didn't know how to backup and keep track of versions.
The whole command line syntaxes are going to take a while to be familiar with, but so far so good.

Since the first attempt to upload this was not successful, I am adding some changes. This is the change!

I was getting a lot of errors when I was trying to push. Then as recommended by Git, I tried to pull 
first before pushing, this didn't work either. So I just deleted the whole thing on my PC, and then 
cloned it again. This is to test the commit again.
