I am very new to programming and I love Udacity. It has made the journey way easier, and more pleasant.
As you can also say, I have just started using Git, which is something that I was looking for (without 
knowing what I was looking for) since I didn't know how to backup and keep track of versions.
The whole command line syntaxes are going to take a while to be familiar with, but so far so good.
